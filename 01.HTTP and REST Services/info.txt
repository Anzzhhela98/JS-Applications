There is no code provided besides the server( which is very basic and not secured for practice purpose only), all the homework was done locally, while working with online databases, HTTP and REST services using AJAX techniques, Postman, OpenSSL(used in virtual Ubuntu) and other tools.

The only reason of uploading these files is so I can have consistency between all the folders.
